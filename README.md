# 👋 Hello! I'm Iza.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a developer specializing in web development. I’m open-minded, curious, and driven by the belief that technology can make a meaningful difference in people's lives.

## 👨‍💻 What I Do
- I specialize in **full stack web development**, with experience in both **front-end** (React, Next.js, TypeScript) and **back-end** (Node.js, GraphQL, REST APIs, Python).
- I enjoy building applications that are **accessible**, **responsive**, and **user-friendly**.
- I’m working on projects that involve **new technologies**, like **server-side rendering** with Next.js 14 and exploring **cloud services** like **AWS** and **Docker**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Front-end:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI  
**Back-end:** Node.js, Django, GraphQL, REST APIs, Django REST Framework  
**Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, 
**Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Drizzle ORM, Turso  
**Deployment & Tools:** Vercel, Netlify, Git, Docker (beginner), AWS (beginner)

## 🚀 Projects
- **Vendora**: A mock e-commerce site built with **Django and React** to get hands-on with full stack development.
- **Art Roam**: A JAMstack web app for exploring artworks from **open museum APIs**, featuring a responsive and accessible design.
- **Kali**: A **digital library of Kankanaey words** aiming to preserve a Northern Philippine dialect. It’s both a cultural project and a learning experience for me.

## 🌱 Learning & Goals
- I’m exploring **infrastructure automation** and cloud services, sparked by my previous work where I got exposed to **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Working on **Vendora**, **Kali**, and **ArtRoamv2** as pinned below.
- Continuously refining my craft to deliver solutions that solve real-world problems.
